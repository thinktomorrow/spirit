# Spirit - frontend toolkit
Your frontend components to build anything. Includnig a style guide.
This toolkit is a guide to bridge the gap between developers and designers.
You can talk about the different components the design needs and how they look,
apart of the general design. In this case you can create a consistent look 'n feel
with a general styleguide which can be used in a discussion.

But keep in mind, that these components aren't written into stone, so you can create
a lot of extra components that the design needs.

Have a lot of fun!
